This abstract class will implement the compareTo method passed on from the
Shape interface and will pass on the responsibility of implementing
calculateArea to the extending sub-classes (compareTo will use the
calculateArea method when comparing 2 Shape objects). Along with compareTo,
one more concrete method should be included. The following will be used by
the sub-classesâ€™ toString method:
