/**
This class represents the rental of a bank's safe deposit box to a
customer. Because banks do not know what is stored in the safe deposit
box, the only information that the class will keep track of is the
name of the person who owns the safe deposit box account (as a
private field).You are to write the code that makes up the methods of this
class (Remember, you are implementing NamedAccount). Also, donâ€™t forget
the name or the owner field.
